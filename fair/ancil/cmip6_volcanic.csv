Volcanic radiative forcing from the CMIP6 dataset,
Sources:,input4MIPs 1850-2014 transient and mean datasets of volcanic aerosol extinction
Method:,Take annual mean of integrated shortwave aerosol extinction at 550 nm from the HadGEM3 input grid
,Take sum of extinction * thickness of each layer = total optical depth
,"Multiply by -18, which is the OD to ERF relationship in HadGEM3, from online model tests as part of the SMURPHS project"
,"Revert to CMIP5 ERF time series for years prior to 1850, scaled by 18/26 and quiescent year positive ERF from 1850-2014 (~0.107) added back"
,Subtract 1850-2014 mean from all years
,Set 2015 onwards to zero
Year,Volcanic ERF
